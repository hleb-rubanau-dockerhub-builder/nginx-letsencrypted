1. NOT CONFIRMED dhparam Not regenerated
2. FIXED letsencrypt creates wrong certificate
3. Most likely, on update/regenerate certbot flags will be wrong (as they are already expanded at bootstrap)

4. On regeneration, false alert about letsencrypt failures is raised. It is also self-locking as error is recorded into same failures log
